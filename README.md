# HTML
Tim Berners-Lee created HTML in 1991 while working at CERN, a research lab in Europe. He wanted to make it easier for scientists to share documents and information across different computers. Inspired by earlier ideas about linking text called hypertext, he designed HTML to connect documents with clickable links. This simple system became the foundation of the World Wide Web we use today.
